This Foundry VTT Adventure is intended to be free to use.

Cult of the Marsh Dragon - Adventure on the Island of Adventure

Cult of the Marsh Dragon is an adventure set in my sandbox module The Island Adventure.

It is a Shadowdark RPG adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party.

Lizardmen from the Great Marsh have been seen near Riverside and people are frightened.

Sir Gregory the Keep Castilian wants the adventurers to investigate and resolve the situation.

The island is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net, Dungeondraft, Unreal Engine and DR free snapshots which allow commercial use of content created with them.

This module contains...

15 x Actors, 1 x Journal Entries, 17 x Scenes and 4 x Folders

Some references have been made to the Foundry VTT Pathfinder Second Edition Game System but no art work or tokens are included. These artwork file references have been included in the packaging of the adventure to indicate the monsters and items the DM should use.
