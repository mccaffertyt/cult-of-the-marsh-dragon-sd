This Foundry VTT Adventure is intended to be free to use.

The Island of Adventure is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

Under Hilltop is a Shadowdark adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party. There is a DnD5e version also available.

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net, Dungeondraft, Unreal Engine and DR free snapshots which allow commercial use of content created with them.

This module contains...

7 x Actors, 1 x Journal Entries, 6 x Scenes and 4 x Folders

Some references have been made to the Foundry VTT Shadowdark Game System but no art work or tokens are included. These artwork file references have been included in the packaging of the adventure to indicate the monsters and items the DM should use.
